Rated R was Rihanna's fourth album, released in November 2009. It was her first album after the infamous assault by her then-boyfriend Chris Brown in February that year. The album reflected her personal turmoil and emotional scars, as well as her artistic growth and maturity. It was a departure from her previous upbeat and catchy pop songs, and instead explored darker and edgier genres such as rock, hip hop, dubstep, and industrial.
 
The album received critical acclaim for its daring and innovative production, lyrics, and vocals. It spawned six singles, including the controversial "Russian Roulette", the fierce "Hard", the sensual "Rude Boy", and the heartbreaking "Cold Case Love". It also featured collaborations with artists such as Jeezy, Slash, will.i.am, and Justin Timberlake. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart, and sold over three million copies worldwide.

Rated R also showcases Rihanna's vocal range and versatility, as she experiments with different styles and tones. On "Rockstar 101", she adopts a raspy rock chick persona, trading verses with guitar legend Slash. On "Te Amo", she sings in Spanish and French over a seductive Latin groove. On "Russian Roulette", she delivers a haunting ballad with a dramatic climax. And on "Cold Case Love", she unleashes a powerful performance that rivals Mariah Carey's vocal acrobatics.
 
The album is not without its flaws, though. Some of the songs are too long and repetitive, such as the six-minute "Cold Case Love" and the four-minute "The Last Song". Some of the lyrics are too vague or clichÃ©d, such as "I'm such a fucking lady" on "Wait Your Turn" and "You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer" on "Fire Bomb". And some of the production choices are too noisy or abrasive, such as the distorted guitars on "Rockstar 101" and the industrial beats on "G4L".
 
But despite these minor drawbacks, Rated R is a remarkable achievement for Rihanna, who has proven herself as an artist who can overcome adversity and reinvent herself. It is an album that reflects her personal journey, but also resonates with anyone who has experienced pain, anger, love, and hope. It is an album that challenges the boundaries of pop music, but also delivers catchy hooks and memorable melodies. It is an album that deserves to be heard and respected by anyone who loves music.
